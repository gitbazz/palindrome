# Palindrome

Determines whether a string of printable ASCII letters (from a to z or from A to Z, case insensitive) stored in memory is a palindrome (i.e., the letters in the string are the same from left to right as from right to left, case insensitive) or not. If palindrome, stores 1 in r0, if not, stores 2 in r0.
